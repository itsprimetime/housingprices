# Identifying Key Features to Predict Home Prices
* Does overall quality of the home matter?
* Do features like living area, bedrooms or squarefeet matter?

## Problem Statement

## Background
Local real estate investors in Aimes, Iowa are looking for key features to generalize the market to guide their next investment decision. 

I will explore the relationship between key features and otur target, sale price, using a Ridge Model and employing VarianceThreshold to identify the most important features. 

I will present the success of my model based on the  "error" (+ or - a $ figure) which is calculated using Root Mean Square Error. 

## Conculsions / Recommendations
The most important features that correlate to sale price are: Overall Quality, Full Baths, and 1st Floor Square Feet.
